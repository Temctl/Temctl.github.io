        <h1>Hello!</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my personal "about me" site!</p>
        <p id="summary">My name is Temuulen Ulziisaikhan. I was born and raised in Mongolia however, I spent my high school years in the US. I finished my high school career as a running start student with both high school diploma and associate degree. Throughout those years I have been studying computer science through my schools and also studied online on my own too. </p>
        <p>I have been doing projects like conway's game of life, fraction calculater, bubble sort and etc. The projects that I have done that were really impactful to me were calculater, different stack list objects, and clothe recognition program from a tensorflow library. Most of them were in java and python. However I am also experienced in c# from working on a game that I was building on unity with a small team. I also have been getting experienced in c++.</p>
        <p>Goal: My near goal is to become a software enginer. However, I wanna continue that path and get into AI and machine learning to create projects that really impacts the lives of our society.</p>
